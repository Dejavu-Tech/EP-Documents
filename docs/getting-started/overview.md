## What is Eater Planet?

**Eater Planet** is a React-based framework that enables rapid development of web applications. It eliminates the repetitive tasks demanded by **CRUD** operations and provides industry standard solutions for critical parts of a project like **authentication**, **access control**, **routing**, **networking**, **state management** and **i18n**.

**Eater Planet** is *headless by design*, offering unlimited styling and customization options.

## What do you mean by "headless" ?

Instead of being a limited set of pre-styled components, **Eater Planet** is a collection of helper `hooks`, `components` and `providers`. They are all decoupled from your *UI* *components* and *business logic*, so they never keep you from customizing your *UI* or coding your own flow.

Eater Planet also ships with ready-made integrations for [Ant Design System](https://ant.design/), [Material UI](https://mui.com/), [Mantine](https://mantine.dev/), and [Chakra UI](https://chakra-ui.com/) for convenience.

All in all, **Eater Planet** just works _seamlessly_ with any _custom designs_ or _UI frameworks_.

## Use cases

**Eater Planet** shines when it comes to *data-intensive* applications like *admin panels*, *dashboards* and *internal tools*. Thanks to the built-in **SSR support**, **Eater Planet** can also power *customer-facing* applications like *storefronts*.
